# Crystals Collector Game

This game involves 2 people: the Player and the Computer. The Computer picks a target number at random that the Player has to reach. The Player has a score that can be increased by clicking on one of the Crystals. Each game, the target number is changed as well as the Crystals' values. Whether you have won or lost, your record will be kept, and you will be notified of if you won or lost the previous game.

The game is a Week 2 project of the Fall 2018 Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program. The project was redone in 2022 without recollection of how it was done before. The frontend design is my own original creation.
